## Add Invincibility Status to Player ✓ [COMPLETED 2025-07-17]

- **Transition to Invincible State**
  - When the player touches the Star item, a trigger fires in the game’s state machine that sets the player’s state to invincible (`isInvincible = true`).

- **Timer-Based Duration Management**
  - Upon picking up the Star, an internal timer starts, typically keeping the player invincible for 20 seconds.
  - When the timer reaches zero, `isInvincible` automatically reverts to `false`, and the player returns to their previous state.

- **Visual and Auditory Feedback**
  - **Audio:** A dedicated Star theme plays—distinct from the regular background music—with a faster rhythm to clearly signal the invincible state.
  - **Visual:** The player model rapidly flashes in rainbow or pastel hues, and a temporary speed boost effect is applied.

## Add Star Item Entity ✓ [COMPLETED 2025-07-17]

- **Spawn Interval**
  - Generated at random intervals between 30 and 40 seconds.

- **Trajectory**
  - Spawns off-screen and accelerates along a path that passes through a random pixel within the central play area (x: center from –30px to +30px, y: center from –30px to +30px). If it leaves the screen bounds, it is destroyed.
- **Collision Behavior**
  - Has no rigid body. On collision with the player, the player's state becomes Invincible and the Star item is immediately destroyed.
